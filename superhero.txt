Once upon a time a superhero slept in because she was stressed AF about having two mortgages
and not working for four months.
She was tried of fixing the mess that the human beings kept making.
Her motivation was at an all time low.
Eventually she managed to drag herself out of bed.
But instead of saving the world she watched Stranger Things on Netflix and ate ice-cream.
The end.
